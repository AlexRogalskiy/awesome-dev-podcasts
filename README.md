# awesome-dev-podcasts
a curated list of awesome dev podcasts and why they are awesome. I don't like normal "awesome" lists because they are usually not well maintained and are typically placed without an explanation of awesome, so here i will actually go out on a limb and say what i think. i'm a webdev and former finance guy so those are my biases.
